FINGERPRINT
===========


On of the key functions that we need to support is the idea of fingerprinting
a particular media item, in a way that:

1. Is not dependent on external databases,
2. is not dependent on storage format
3. is replicable
4. is (relatively) fast.
5. is universally unique enough

Something that is readily apparent is that it is unlikely that any single
fingerprinting method will suffice.  Therefore, we define the fingerprint
library interface for seeking or providing multiple mechanisms in a
storage-agnostic manner.
